## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Paul. I am a AI Engineering Consultant. 

I have built various customized ml solutions in the e-commerce and digital marketing space, inclduing recommendation systems, ad spend optimzations and personalization algorithms. Also I have be moving big chunks of data from here to there and tried not to lose any while doing that. I am always interested in new technology but also in solving the organizational, social and managerial challenges of the new data era.
